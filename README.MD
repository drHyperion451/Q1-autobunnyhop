Q1-autobunnyhop
=======
Very simple mod that enable autobunnyhopping on the game (like how Dusk does lol).

Just removes the "pogo limitation" at 1041 from `client.qc`. Nothing more special.

The mod only works on the original id1 game.
# Instalation
1. Download from the releases tab the latest zip.
2. Uncompress the zip inside main Quake folder. If you are playing nightdives rerelease just put inside the rerelease folder.
3. Play the game with the launch parameter `-game autobunnyhop`. Or select the mod inside the mod menu in ironwail or the quake rerelease.
